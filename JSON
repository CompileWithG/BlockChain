JSON Introduction
When storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you choose to store it, text is always one of the legal formats. JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text.
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard data format that's often used to exchange data between web applications and servers. It's text-based, so it can be read by both humans and computers, and it's independent of any programming language. This makes JSON ideal for exchanging data across different platforms and programming languages.
