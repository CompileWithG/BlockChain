What is the environment variable?
Environment Variables are key-value pairs configured outside your source code so that each value can change depending on the Environment. Your source code can read these values to change behavior during the Build Step or during Function execution.
for example:we create  environment variables instead of hard coding the private key of a crypto wallet to avaoid breach of information

private_key=os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY")
we can store all environment variables in a .env file
make sure to add the .env file to .gitignore
pip install python-dotenv
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()--automatically loads the .env file in which all environment vairables are there into the code
